January 19, 2004. enCore version 4.0.1

- Upped default quota to 100.000 bytes for new installations
- Fixed a css format problem in $encore_web_class:css Introduced in 4.0.
- Fixed a layout issue with $webpage:_html. Introduced in 4.0.
- Fixed a small problem with $administration_module:batch_make_player that was introduced in 4.0.
- Added task_perms to $prog:@code in order to prevent folks from viewing non-readable code.
- Added additional permission checks to $xpress_moo_mailer:permission_to_read in order to plug a critical security hole that allowed users to read other player's mail as well as wiz only lists. Thanks to Wade Wesolowsky for bringing these last two issues to my attention.

 
January 9, 2004. enCore version 4.0

- Changed argument separator from '&' to ';' at the recommendation of W3C. Please note, if you have verbs that send URL encoded data you *must* update the arg separator to ; or else your code will break.
- Implemented an improved MOO mailer package by Daniel Jung. New features include searching, printing, mail preview pane, and general layout improvements. Thanks MUCH Daniel!
- Transitioned from HTML to XHTM 1.0. Removed about 98% of all tagging from the code and created a set of new markup verbs on $encore_web_utils to handle all markup. Converted all tags from upper- to lowercase, enclosed all values in quotemarks, closed all tags, also empty elements. I.e <br /> Heckuva job ;) 99% of the system now validates as XHTML 1.0 Transitional. NOTE TO PROGRAMMERS: You are strongly encouraged to use the new markup verbs instead of writing tags directly in your code.
- Removed property $httpd.expires
- Added property $httpd.charset with value "ISO-8859-1"
- Removed references to path, domain, and expires from  $httpd:generate_server_response_header. This was done in order to set cookies properly in certain browsers such as Safari. This information is optional in the cookie header.
- Added 'widescreen' options to $xpress_client.screen_sizes
- Made Xpress client window resizable. 
- Added a : separator to the cookie string in order to remove the white space that was there before. This was done to achieve better standards comliance. Affected verbs are $Xpress_client:initialize_session (cookie encoding) and $httpd:authenticate (cookie decoding)
- Removed MacOS specific checks from $Xpress_client:initialize_session. This code was originally added to deal with older versions of MSIE and Netscape. Newer versions of both browsers has made the check obsolete. These changes has made it possible to run Xpress in many more browsers. I have successfully tested this version of enCore in Mozilla/Firebird, Safari 1.1.1, and IE 5.2 on Mac OS X, and Internet Explorer 6.0 and Mozilla 1.5 on Windows. Please note that this means that enCore 4.0 will probably no longer work with some older browsers.
- Simplified the login form generated by $xpress_login:login. Newer browsers has made the checks performed by the old code obsolete.
- Changed layout of all tabular data in the system via css.
- Using CSS instead of table for layout. Exception for tabular data where an improved version of $encore_web_utils:generate_table is still used.
- Created new place holder named $xpress_misc for miscellaneous Xpress verbs and properties. This is a CGI application which means that it accepts unauthenticated requests. If your verbs require authentication to not put them here!
- And many more tweaks to the interface.


November 16, 2003. enCore version 3.3.4

- Modified $login:autoconnect and $httpd:autenticate to prevent unauthorized access by exploiting a security hole in these two verbs.
- Modified $Xpress_client:initialize_session to add a warning that web-based wizard connections are inherently unsafe.

Thanks to Michel@Achieve for these contributions.


January 25, 2003. enCore version 3.3.3

- Added referrer check to $httpd:get. Clients are now only allowed to send url encoded data to the MOO if the referring page originated from the same MOO.

- $player:notify now scans and strips URL encoded data from URLs received via the telnet applet. This prevents malicious users from sending unauthorized code to the MOO via MOOtcan.

Thanks to Scott Carmichael for these contributions.


January 5, 2003. enCore version 3.3.2

- Made a series of xpress releated properties on $player and $encore_web_class editable by owners. The security update in patch 3.3.1 broke editing access in several places. By making the affected properties editable by object owners (+c) normal editing capability has been restored.


December 17, 2002. enCore version 3.3.1

- Plugged a serious security hole in $xpress_program_editor:save_property_value that allowed random users to change property values which they should not have permission to touch. Many thanks to Wes Cooper for reporting this issue and to Alexandre Borgia for input on the fix.

- Made property $encore_web_class.shared_owners editable by owner.


December 11, 2002. enCore version 3.3

- Fixed a serious security hole in $xpress_program_editor:coerce whereby conventinal player characters could be turned into wizard characters. Alexandre Borgia explains: "What I did is rewrite the "coerce" verb so it no longer depends on eval to typecast to complex types as LISTs or FLOATs." Thanks to Alexandre for identifying and fixing this problem.

- Fixed some layout issues with $slide_projector:show and rev. Thanks to Hervé Collin and others.

- Fixed a problem with $encore_web_object:make_contextual_menu so that back button now works in Netscape. Thanks to Matt Beerman.

- Fixed a problem with $xpress_object_editor:menu_html that caused javascript errors in certain browsers. Thanks to Richard Bowman.

- Fixed a problem with $webprojector:start. Thanks to Ken Schweller for providing the fix.

- Added a try clause to $encore_web_utils:can_handle to prevent the verb from breaking in case of datatype errors.

- Fixed a layout issue with $xpress_object_editor:Edit_Web_Slides

- Added a copyright property to make it easier to update dates in future releases.


September 30, 2001. enCore version 3.2

enCore version 3.2 is a combined update and maintenance release. The update concerns primarily the MOOtcan telnet applet which has been updated to work with the Java 2 based VM in Mac OS X 10.1 which was available on Sept 29 in the U.S. So far, only MacOS X Internet Explorer 5.1 supports applets, but I expect the other browsers will soon follow. 

- Changed value of $xpress_client.java_client_filename to "MOOtcan.class" in order to use Java Archive (JAR) file instead of class files. 

- Modified $xpress_client:init_for_core to reflect new default MOOtcan class name.

- Modified $xpress_client.javascript_functions. Javascript function _MRJAdvise() will now prevent Mac users with old Java 1.0 browsers from connecting. Instead they are directed to the Xpress system requirements page.

- Added back button to web view for all objects except rooms. Thanks to Matthew Beerman for the suggestion. For aesthetical and consistency reasons, I decided to implement it via the Xpress contextual menu instead of adding a form-type button to the page view. New icon, back.gif was created for this purpose. Modified $encore_web_class:make_contextual_menu so that back button icon appears first, and @program $encore_web_utils:get_title to make contextual menu appear on separate line so that back button will always be in the same posision. Does not currently work in Netscape 4.X.

- Added ability to change alignment of descriptions, note texts, multimedia content. Thanks to my good friend John Barber for making this suggestion.

- Matthew Beerman found a security problem with $encore_utils:read. This verb has now been removed and $command_utils:read is used instead. Affected verbs are $note_board:configure and $encore_web_object:@webpref. Both of these verbs have been updated to use $command_utils:read. If anyone is using $encore_utils:read locally, they need to update their code to use $command_utils:read. Do a @grep $encore_utils:read to find any occurrences.

The good folks over at Achieve (http://achieve.utoronto.ca:2221), Jason Nolan, Matthew Beerman et. al. have passed along a number of fixes and enhancements. Matthew's explanation of these follows below. Thanks for the contribution, we sure do appreciate it!

$room:_html
- We altered it to use this:obvious_exits() instead of exit.obvious, since some rooms generate the list of exists in a dynamic and varying fashion.

$encore_web_utils:tell_locked
- We modified this so that rooms have the ability to set their own locked messages (that is, if the room defines a property .locked_msg, use it instead).

$encore_web_utils:move_via_web
- Now, the value of "player" is correctly set before the move is done; certain rooms' :exitfunc() and :enterfunc() were depending on player being a valid object, and thus failing.

$encore_web_object:_html
- Several changes here by popular demand: Most players preferred having the descriptions of $notes printed, so we removed that special case. And by overwhelming demand, we added a "Back" button to all objects (except $rooms), which simply returns you to the page you were viewing before. Otherwise, you have to look at the room again to get the description back. (Note: Back button was actually implemented via the Xpress contextual menu in enCore. -Jan)

$xpress_moo_mailer:compose
- We added an explanatory message on the expected format of the To: line, and a warning dialogue that prompts you before discarding a message in progress.

$xpress_object_editor:create_new_object
- This verb had a bug whereby if the user was over quota (around line 31), it would traceback later on because the values of vrb and object were never set. A simple typo we fixed.


	MOOTcan-0.50 Alpha Release.

	* Rewrote event handling routines in CommandTextField.java and ControlPanel.java to use Java 1.1 event handling instead of Java 1.0. The Java 1.1 TextArea is now used exclusively. This was done to add support for browsers running Java 2 VMs under MacOS X and possibly other platforms. The downside of this change is that older Java 1.0 based versions of Netscape under MacOS 8/9 will no longer be able to run MOOtcan without the MRJ-Plugin installed.

	* Rewrote calls to all deprecated methods throughout the program.
	
	* Removed class Modes.java since new event handling system has been implemented.

	* It is not generally recommended to mix Java 1.0 and Java 1.1 code in a program so I cleaned out as much 1.0 code as I could. The rest will have to wait.

	* Up arrow and down arrow can now be used for history navigation in CommandTextField.java. Should work in all browsers.

	* Removed package statements from all classes. Couldn't see that these serve any purpose in this program.

	* Since we no longer need to worry about Java 1.0 browsers, I'm now using jar to wrap the applet into an archive. The loadtime should improve quite a bit now since the browser no longer has to make several http connections to download all the program classes. 

	* Upped the max character display of UserOutputArea to 25.000 characters. 	

	* Removed some debugging code from various classes.

	* Generated new and updated JavaDoc Documentation.


September 17, 2001. enCore version 3.1

- Wrote new system to allow automatic character creation in Xpress. This is off by default, but administrators can turn it on in the Wizard Module's enCore settings. When on, a button named 'Create Account' will appear on the login screen allowing users to create accounts automatically without having to go through the current screening process. Modifications include changes to $administration_module:core_settings, $administration_module:edit_naming, $Xpress_login:login, $guest:_web_menu, plus new verbs $administration_module:edit_login, and $xpress_login:character_application_html.
Thanks to Claudijo Borovic for suggestions and contribution of code.

- Implemented support for embedded audio content. Users can now connect both audio and visual multi-media content to MOO objects. An option to specify audio content has been added to the Xpress object editor. Audio content is invisible and will play automatically when users look at an object with such associated content. Changed the default sound setting to on, volume low for all players. Players who do not wish to hear audio content may turn sound off using the sound preferences under the Options toolbar button. Modifications affect the following verbs: $xpress_object_editor:edit_url, $encore_web_object:_html, and $encore_web_utils:make_sound. A new property $encore_web_class.audio_url has been added. Updated help text for $encore_help.quick_editing. Thanks to Dene Grigar for suggesting this feature.

- Added MP3 to list of recognized extentions in $httpd.embed_file_suffixes.

- Added HTML comments to the following _html verbs: $encore_web_class:_html and $room:_html.

- Added the ability to run slide shows on $webprojector. New commands added include $webprojector:"start stop reset" and $webprojector:@setdelay. Thanks to Lennie Irvin for suggesting this new feature.

- Fixed a bug in $encore_web_utils:get_icon that broke the system when users asked for objects with no icon property. This fix was previously released unofficially as enCore 3.0.3b1. Thanks to Claudijo Borovic for reporting this bug.

- Removed redundant code from $xpress_login:login. Thanks to beuja@iinet.net.au

- Modified $slide_projector:show to remove redundant empty lines. Thanks to Lennie Irvin for suggestion and Rv for code.

- Modified $note_board:remove to allow the note board's owner to remove posted notes. Thanks to Emily Marcus for suggesting this change.

- Fixed a permissions bug in $note_board:configure.

- Modified Message of the Day alert to not show popup alerts to guests. In MOOs where guest self naming is enabled there has been reports of problems where the MOTD alert would interfere with guests' ability to name themselves. Guests now see the MOTD message in the java applet instead.


August 21, 2001. enCore version 3.0.2

- Fixed a bug in the Xpress web server response header. Content type was not always returned and this caused Xpress to break on some http standards compliant browsers. Modified $httpd:generate_server_response_header and $httpd.checkclient. This version has been tested with Mozilla 0.9.3 and Netscape 6.1 on MacOS 9.1 and Windows 2000.

Thanks to Andreas Bogk for help in troubleshooting this issue.


July 20, 2001. enCore version 3.0.1

- Fixed a problem with Xpress Program Editor in MOO's built prior to the original enCore database. When $server_options.support_numeric_verbname_strings was set to 1, Xpress would erroniously pick the wrong verb. The fix for this include modifications to $xpress_program_editor:edit_verb, $xpress_program_editor:delete_verb and $xpress_program_editor:compiler_html. In addition, I also fixed a potential problem with identically named verbs in $xpress_program_editor:compiler_html. This was done by using verb number instead of verb name as reference. Thanks to Beermann for help with troubleshooting this issue.

- Fixed a performance issue with $xpress_object_editor:editor_html

- Modified $httpd:generate_server_response_header and removed a semi-colon from set cookie instructions to prevent breaking authentication from certain browsers.

- Fixed a display bug in $help_browser:help_contents_html. Thanks to Hervé Collin.

- Fixed typos and grammatical errors in certain help properties.


April 15, 2001. enCore version 3.0

- Redesigned the Xpress Client interface with 361 new icons and toolbar buttons. Implemented support for themes. Users have 10 default themes to choose from. New themes can be added fairly easily.

- Added TITLE tag to icons, so tooltips now work on all platforms.

- Added a web hits counter that will keep track of how many times an object has been accessed. The counter is stored in $encore_web_object.hits. Modified $encore_web_object:_html and added verb $encore_web_object:update_hits

- Wrote new subclass of $encore_web_application named $encore_cgi_application to allow for unauthenticated access to  access to Xpress applications. This allows a wizard to write CGI/PHP type scripts as MOO verbs and use the MOO as a backend database structure. Added property $encore_cgi_application.allow_anonymous_access (0/1) that governs whether or not a cgibin application can receive data from unauthenticated connections. Anonymous access is on by default, but fertile is set to -f to prevent non-wizards from using this class. Modified $httpd:authenticate, and added verb $encore_web_utils:anonymous_access. Removed property $xpress_client.HTTP09_registry.

- Renamed $httpd:execute_http_request to get because the name was too darn long ;-)

- Redesigned the Xpress login pages. Create new $encore_cgi_application named $xpress_login. Moved old :display_login_page to this object and renamed it login. Wrote new verb :login_page which will display two frames, one with the login form, the other with the MOO's custom login screen. This solves the problem of dependency between the two. Made modifications in $httpd:get, $httpd:authenticate, and $xpress_client:initialize_session to accommodate the new system.

- Added DOCTYPE to $encore_web_class.

- Updated the Who Browser. Added column for activity message. Removed search capability since this is already implemented in $search_engine. Added alias @activity to $player:@doing

- Designed new combined verb and property editor named $Xpress_Program_Editor. The new editor can handle all types of properties including lists of lists. The $Xpress_Property_Editor is now defunct and has been removed.

- Modified $xpress_verb_editor:compiler_html and the way prepositions are determined to fix problems with prepositions of more than one word.

- Updated Xpress About ($moo_info:about_html) with information on uptime and last backup time.

- Fixed a potential bug in $xpress_client:initialize_session

- Modified the Xpress bookmark application to allow users to add their own personal bookmarks of rooms they visit frequently. Added property $player.xpress_bookmarks, modified $xpress_navigator:bookmarks_html, added verbs $xpress_navigator:"add_bookmark remove_bookmark", and wrote new help text.

- Added Bookmark, Generics and Message of the Day editors to the Xpress Administration Module.

- Wrote new Message of the Day (MOTD) login-announcement system. Wizards now have a convenient way to display short messages to users when they log in. Added verb $administration_module:edit_motd_html, modified $player:confunc, added $xpress_client:check_motd, modified $xpress_client:Xpress_Confunc. Wrote help text for the MOTD system. 

- Wrote new Generics Management system. Wizards can now easily create new Object Editor generics categories and add or remove generic objects from these categories. Removed old generics storage on Object Editor and replaced it with $xpress_object_editor.generics. Added verbs $administration_module:edit_generics_html, $administration_module:"create_generics update_generics delete_generics", and $xpress_object_editor:init_for_core. Modified verb $xpress_object_editor:classes_html. 

- Rewrote the Core Settings/Preference system on Administration Module to use a new menu-based selection system. Added and updated various preference settings.

- Removed ability to save Xpress Notebook and Log to disk. The reason is that browsers on different platforms handles saving differently, and thus we experienced various problems in getting it to work across platforms. Modified $xpress_navigator:notebook and $xpress_navigator:MOO-Log, and removed $xpress_navigator:save_to_disk.

- Rewrote the Object Editor. Quick editing is no longer done in one long form. Editing options are instead defined by new verbs named Xpress_edit on the generic objects. Users now have the option to share objects with others for collaborative editing. A shared object can only be programmed by it's owner, however, and properties that are not available for Xpress editing can only be modifed by the object's owner. A confirmation dialog on recycling was added to prevent accidental recycling of objects. In the new system, several verbs for manipulating properties has been moved from the defunct property editor to the object editor. Fixed an object matching bug in $xpress_object_editor:view_html.

- Added user control of screen size and and screen division. Available screen sizes are 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768 and Full Screen (default). Available divisions between the talk and web areas are 30%/70%, 40%/60%, 50%/50% (default), 60%/40%, 70%/30%. Added administrator system wide control of these settings to Xpress MOO Administration, enCore Settings.

- Fixed a problem with $Xpress_object_editor:recycle_object where recycling of rooms did not clean up and recycle entrances and exits.

- Added confirmation dialogue to deletion of accounts in Xpress account administration. 

- Fixed a bug in $xpress_MOO_Mailer:delete_mail_html. Added quick links to delete mail from main folder contents view, and removed the delete mail button from $xpress_moo_mailer:view_html.

- Wrote a new system for sharing objects through the Xpress Object Editor. Additional owners may now edit properties that are made available through the Object Editor. Shared owners may not edit verbs or other properties, nor cann they recycle objects. Added new verbs $Xpress_object_editor:edit_sharing, $xpress_object_editor:share_object and $xpress_object_editor:permission_to_edit, and property $encore_web_class.shared_owners. Wrote help text on $builder_help.

- New xpress edit function added to contextual menu. Objects that the user can edit now has a small pen icon next to their name. Clicking on the icon opens up the Xpress Object Editor with the selected object ready for editing. 

- Added the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual to the core distribution. Added new property $xpress_client.texts. Thanks to Pavel Curtis.

- Redefined the size and layout of all enCore web application windows. Made windows resizable by default, except for $xpress_client and $mootcan. If these windows are resized some browsers will crash because java does not handle dynamic resizing of Applets.

- Updated $xpress_object_editor:set_property, and added new verb $news:notify_Xpress_change. Users will now be notified about news items updated through Xpress.

- Fixed a bug in $encore_web_utils:get_text_linebreak. Thanks to Hervé Collin for reporting.

- Changed the data type of exit messages from integer to string so they can now be edited in Xpress. Also fixed $encore_web_utils:move_via_web so that it now uses exit messages if they exist. If not, it defaults to standard movement messages.

- Fixed a problem with the anonymous browse mode on login. It now displays toolbar and location in MSIE

- Changed the Xpress Object layout system from presentational tags to stylesheets. An embedded stylesheet is generated on-the-fly for each object. Alternatively, a MOO administrator can opt to use external stylesheets for greater layout consistency. Cleaned up and removed presentational tags <FONT>, <BGCOLOR> etc from Xpress code. 

- Rewrote the Xpress object appearance scheme. In the new system, the appearance of an object is controlled by the owner of the object. A user can still override these settings and use their own. This option, however, is off by default.

- Renamed $encore_web_application:pre_assemble to :build, and moved it to $encore_web_class

- Installed VASE version 3.0. Thanks to Jason Nolan and Matthew Beermann for updating this excellent application!

- The following verbs on $encore_web_utils have been DEPRECIATED: generate_head, get_page_properties. These verbs have been replaced by make_head, make_body and make_page. The depreciated verbs are still present in the core, but programmers are strongly encouraged to update their code to use the new verbs instead. $encore_web_utils:set_font_properties, and $encore_web_utils:font_size has also been depreciated due to the new stylesheet based layout system.

- The enCore 3.0 update consists of over 12500 lines of code so it's impossible to document every change here. Please see the patch file itself for details.

June 18, 2000. enCore version 2.1.1

- Fixed a missing character substitution in $xpress_navigator:menu_html. Thanks to William Painter for pointing out this problem.
- Fixed an issue with $xpress_client:check_moo_mail that broke login for players.
- To prevent future issues with the above I made $frand_class the default $player_class and rewrote $administration_module:view_html so that all new player objects made with Xpress will be based on $frand_class by default. Thanks to Roy Kennedy and others on the enCore-list for bringing this issue to our attention.

June 9, 2000. enCore version 2.1

- Removed $web_slate. This object is no longer being supported by its developer and does no longer work.
- Modified the locking system so that it works properly with Xpress. This required modifications to several _html verbs.
- Modified the generic classroom so that objects such as recorders placed on tables pick up conversation.
- Added new command @hide that allows players not to be listed in the who listing if they wish. Modification to $player:@who required.
- Fixed a problem with $guest:do_reset that caused guest accounts not to be properly reset.
- Added a fix to #0:"do_out_of_band_command" so MacMOOSE and tkMOO works properly with enCore. Thanks to Stephen Ashley for contributing this fix.
- Modified $xpress_navigator:menu_html to add button for the VASE system.
- Added Jason Nolan's Virtual Assignment Server Environment (VASE). This system consists of three new core objects, $assignment_server, $assignment, and $assignment_help. For more info see http://achieve.forestry.utoronto.ca/vase/. Thanks to Jason Nolan and Matthew Beerman for contributing the VASE system to the enCore project.

April 1, 2000. enCore version 2.0.6

This patch addresses certain compatibility issues with Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 for Macintosh which was released on 03/26/00. The fixes in this patch makes Xpress work with this browser. There are, however, a few outstanding issues. See below.

- Fixed a bug in $Xpress_Navigator:MOO_log that I overlooked in the last patch.
- Fixed an MSIE 5.0 Mac compatibility issue in $xpress_moo_mailer:compose.
- For some strange reason MSIE 5.0 Mac displays Applet ALT tags. Had to modify the Javascript in $xpress_client.javascript_functions, as well as $mootcan:standalone_html to prevent the browser from erroneously showing a message saying that Java must be enabled.
- Removed reference to Netscape Live Audio plug-in in $player:quick_edit.
- Updated the Xpress FAQ with information about MSIE 5.0 Mac.

Outstanding issues with MSIE 5.0 Mac

- MSIE 5 uses the default sans-serif font to override page specified fonts in all forms. This means that in the default setup, ASCII drawings look skewed in the Xpress Editors. I have never encountered this problem in any other browser. Workaround: Use a monospace font such as Courier as default sans-serif font.
- Save to disk in the Notebook and Log applications is broken. MSIE 5 Mac uses a download manager to fetch files and documents. So far I have not been able to find a solution to this problem. Workaround: Save via email instead.

March 25, 2000. enCore version 2.0.5

- Fixed a permission issue with $player.Xpress_Notebook and $player.Xpress_Log. Both properties are now -rc
- Removed the following verbs $encore_web_utils:text_save_options $Xpress_Navigator:log_options and $encore_web_application:generate_plain_text. A revised save to disk system makes these verbs obsolete. The property $httpd.text_mime_types was removed for the same reason. See below.
- Added properties $player.Xpress_Confunc_Msg, $Xpress_Client.MOTD_Msg, $Xpress_Client.MOTD_viewer_list, $Xpress_MOO_Mailer.messages_to_display. The MOTD (Message of the day) properties are not being used right now, but was added in preparation for new features in an upcoming version.
- Added a series of reserved characters and words to $player_db.reserved
- Modified $encore_web_utils:form so that 'simple' forms beginning with only a FORM tag is no longer possible. This was done to ensure that all forms are received as POSTs by Xpress.
- Rewrote $xpress_navigator:MOO-Log to fix problems with lost logs. The new system should prevent loss of data.
- Updated $Xpress_Navigator:Xpress_Notebook to take advantage of new features. See below.
- Wrote a new system that allows the Log and Notebook applications to save data to disk or via email. Contents in these applications can now also be erased. New verb $xpress_Navigator:save_via_email was added.
- Fixed a small issue with $Xpress_MOO_Mailer:sendmail where the subject was included as the first line of the mail message.
- Added new verb $Xpress_client:Xpress_Confunc. This verb is used to generate various login messages when users connect with Xpress. Called from $xpress_client:menu_html.
- Updated $player:reset_xpress_session. This verb now informs players about aborted logs next time they log in.
- Fixed an issue with $encore_web_utils:make_sound that caused certain browser plug-ins to throw exceptions. Thanks to Matthew Beermann for suggesting this fix. 
- Added Matthew Beermann's update to $encore_web_utils:detect_urls. URLs that are already marked up will now be ignored.
- Added a new verb $Xpress_MOO_Mailer:permission_to_read that provides authentication services to Xpress MOO Mailer verbs.
- Rewrote the Xpress Mailer so that only a certain number of messages in a mail box is displayed at any given time. A quick access menu is automatically generated to provide easy access to other messages in the mail box. This update required modifications in $Xpress_MOO_Mailer:contents_html, $Xpress_MOO_Mailer:folders_html, and $xpress_MOO_mailer:view_html.
- Modified $Xpress_property_editor:set_property_html once again. This time I believe the problems related to player names and aliases has been properly adressed through the addition of $Xpress_property_editor:rename and the modification of $player_db:why_bad_name and $encore_web_class:quick_edit.
- Added Matthew Beermann's new version of $encore_web_utils:parse_url that makes it possible for non-$encore_web_applications
to have web-enabled verbs other than :_html, so long as they are +x and end
in _html
- Updated the following help texts to reflect changes in this version: $encore_help.logging, $encore_help.notebook, and $encore_help.quick_editing.

February 13, 2000. enCore version 2.0.4

- Fixed a problem with $xpress_client:character_application_html so that information in the form is preserved in case the chosen name is already taken and the form has to be returned to user.
- Modified $xpress_property_editor:main_html call $encore_web_application:blank_html.
- Fixed a rather serious bug in $xpress_property_editor:set_property_html where player names were not treated as special cases, and thus, were not updated in the $player_db. This led to problems with page @join etc for folks who had changed their names using Xpress. Wrote a small utility verb that fixes current name problems. 
- Fixed an elusive bug in $encore_web_utils:form where forms were not sent with method POST specified. This caused certain clients such as MSIE to truncate long posts. Thanks to Roxanne Mountford and the OldPuebloMOO wiz team for bringing this to our attention. This should also solve the problems Windows users have had with compiling long verbs and saving long texts.
- The bugfix above led to three other problem with $encore_web_utils:parse_multipart_form_data. 1) Had to trim off leading and trailing quote marks added by the sending client. 2) Had to set the verb - d (-debug) to prevent it from throwing a Range Error 3) Had to comment out an if-statement that began to return empty strings as empty lists. My tests have not yet produced any problems after these changes, but since this is such a crucial verb, it is possible that we'll run into situation that cause problems. Will have to keep an eye on this.
- Modified $who_browser:main_html so that the window closes automatically when clicking on a player name in the who-listing.
- Updated copyright notices in $xpress_client:display_login_page, $encore_web_utils:generate_head and #0.license.
- Modified $player:quick_edit so that it won't show encrypted old password. Some folks have claimed that the old way was confusing.
- Modified $quota_utils:bi_create to avoid an obscure bug that causes $builder:_create and $quota_utils:bi_create to start calling each other in a loop only terminated by the Too many verb calls exception. Thanks to Roxanne Mountford and the OldPuebloMOO wiz team for bringing this to my attention.
- Adjusted certain window sizes to make them larger and better looking in Microsoft Windows.

November 28, 1999. enCore version 2.0.3

- Set Xpress Who Browser to use available screen height by default.
